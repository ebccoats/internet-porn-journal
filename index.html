    <h1>Wear & Tear Website</h1>
    <p>Preserving the Oldest Porn on the Internet for Future Generations</p>
    <div class="pre-container">

    You can touch objects in museums.
            
    Museum staff hate it, but it's often possible.
        </pre>
        <div class="tear-off-div"></div>
    </div>
    <p>The reason not to touch museum objects is because nobody wants to go to a museum to see dust that used to be museum objects. Also, if museum staff catch you touching things, you are in trouble. So there are a few consequences.</p>
    <p>Why porn? (see title ^)</p>
    <p>On the internet, you're anonymous and you can touch anything you want... but there can still be consequences (if someone designs them).</p>
    <h2>A Worn Out Website</h2>
    <p>For my first project in cousin bootcamp, I spent two months wrestling with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> to make a very short game of keepaway. For my second project, I thought a website that visibly wears out as people use it would be really cool. Totally useless from a product perspective, but I want something simple to learn fullstack development on and I like making cool things, not viable products that people want.</p>
    <p>But what can I put on this website to get enough traffic to wear it out? </p>
    <p><div class="center">
        <button id="activate-sexy-lady">Maybe A Computer-Loving Sexy Lady?</button>
    </div></p>
    <p>(put the image here when you click the button)</p>
    <p><div class="center">
        <button id="asciivate-sexy-lady">In ASCII?</button>
    </div></p>

    <h2>Part I. Setup: 4/1/25</h2>
    <p>What I did tonight: I figured out what the project journal will look like. When I think about the early internet, I remember how loud things like modems and printers were. Modem songs have had a renaissance in the modern era, probably because they sound nice, but continuous feed dot matrix printers were 45x as loud and I think that deserves some acknowledgement.</p>
    <p>Here's what <code>inline code</code> will look like. </p>

    <div class="pre-container">
    <div class="tear-off-div"></div>
    <pre>
     
    print("hello world")

    print("this is how code blocks will be styled")
    print("it took multiple hours to make this in css")
    
    print("and I have no plans to use this in the actual project...")
    print("actually it could be cool as the donations leaderboard?")

    </pre>
    <div class="tear-off-div"></div>
</div>
<p>Tomorrow maybe I'll work on making a monitor in CSS.</p>
<p>I also did a bunch of work on the narrative here on this page.</p>

<h2>The Museum Part 4/3/25</h2>
<p>Ok, so part of this project is the museum that contains the historical piece of porn. What should it look like? </p>
<p>Well, museums are always white, empty, clean looking. So a white background obviously. But what about typefaces and design?</p>
<p>I looked at a few of museums for reference. Museums don't really do drop shadows.</p>

<div class="pre-container">
<img src="journal-assets/moma-ps1-reference.png" width="300">
<p>Moma PS1 is the most recent museum I went to. Their website is too hip for what I want.</p>
</div>

<div class="pre-container">
    <p>The Computer History museum in Mountain View is a museum I've never been to, but I did drive past it a lot. This design is great for a museum that is in an office park but I want museum-museum aesthetic.</p>

</div>

<div class="pre-container"><img src="journal-assets/muda-reference.png" width="300">
<p>The MUseum for Digital Art was in Z端rich and I liked going there when I was on work trips. I like how empty and clean the page is.</p>
</div>

<div class="pre-container">
<img src="journal-assets/museum-fur-gestaltung-reference.png" width="300">
<p>Museum f端r Gestaltung has more elements to borrow from. And I also liked going there on work trips to Z端rich.</p>
</div>

<h3>Analyzing Museum f端r Gestaltung design</h3>
<p>Ok. I like that it's only one font, all I have to do is figure out how they're using it. The font is Riforma Museum in 300 and 800 weight. But I want to use a Google font. So what is going on here?</p>
<img src="journal-assets/gestaltung-title.png" width="300">
<br>
Poppins is pretty close, but the <code>G</code> and <code>a</code> are modern shapes instead of old timey.
<img src="journal-assets/poppins-title.png" width="300">
<br>
Jost is also close, the letters are the right level of modern, but the <code>M</code> looks drunk or worn out or something. Not respectable and museumlike.
<br>
<img src="journal-assets/jost-example.png" width="300">
<br>
This is a nice match. The <code>G</code> and <code>a</code> are classic, the <code>M</code> is upright and has a low middle, and although the umlauts are round instead of square, I can live with that because there are no umlauts in "Institute of Internet Pornography."
