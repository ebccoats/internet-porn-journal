    <h1>Wear & Tear Website</h1>
    <p>Preserving the Oldest Porn on the Internet for Future Generations</p>
    <div class="pre-container">
        <div class="tear-off-div"></div>
        <pre>
         
    You can touch objects in museums.
            
    Museum staff hate it, but it's often possible.
        </pre>
        <div class="tear-off-div"></div>
    </div>
    <p>The reason not to touch museum objects is because nobody wants to go to a museum to see dust that used to be museum objects. Also, if museum staff catch you touching things, you are in trouble. So there are a few consequences.</p>
    <p>Why porn? (see title ^)</p>
    <p>On the internet, you're anonymous and you can touch anything you want... but there can still be consequences (if someone designs them).</p>
    <h2>A Worn Out Website</h2>
    <p>For my first project in cousin bootcamp, I spent two months wrestling with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> to make a very short game of keepaway. For my second project, I thought a website that visibly wears out as people use it would be really cool. Totally useless from a product perspective, but I want something simple to learn fullstack development on and I like making cool things, not viable products that people want.</p>
    <p>But what can I put on this website to get enough traffic to wear it out? </p>
    <p><div class="center">
        <button id="activate-sexy-lady">Maybe A Computer-Loving Sexy Lady?</button>
    </div></p>
    <p>(put the image here when you click the button)</p>
    <p><div class="center">
        <button id="asciivate-sexy-lady">In ASCII?</button>
    </div></p>

    <h2>Part I. Setup: 4/1/25</h2>
    <p>What I did tonight: I figured out what the project journal will look like. When I think about the early internet, I remember how loud things like modems and printers were. Modem songs have had a renaissance in the modern era, probably because they sound nice, but continuous feed dot matrix printers were 45x as loud and I think that deserves some acknowledgement.</p>
    <p>Here's what <code>inline code</code> will look like. </p>

    <div class="pre-container">
    <div class="tear-off-div"></div>
    <pre>
     
    print("hello world")

    print("this is how code blocks will be styled")
    print("it took multiple hours to make this in css")
    
    print("and I have no plans to use this in the actual project...")
    print("actually it could be cool as the donations leaderboard?")

    </pre>
    <div class="tear-off-div"></div>
</div>
<p>Tomorrow maybe I'll work on making a monitor in CSS.</p>
<p>I also did a bunch of work on the narrative here on this page.</p>
